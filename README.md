Several scenarios may be run and are described in comment sections. 
Model adding/removing liquidity from the pool.
Model trading ETH or TKN into and out of the pool.
Model arbitrage from some external market into the pool, or pool to market, on either asset using the optimum arbitrage trade value.
Model a black swan event and impermanent loss.
