# Pool and market ecosystems 
This program let's the user create starting pool and market states.
It then randomly generates trades against the pool, arbitrage between the pool and market, and black swan events at the user's discretion.

Several scenarios may be run and are described in comment sections within the code. The user can:
* Model adding/removing liquidity from the pool;
* Model trading ETH or TKN into and out of the pool;
* Model arbitrage from some external market into the pool, or from pool to market, on either asset using an optimum arbitrage trade value.
* Model a black swan event and impermanent loss.

Code written in Python 3.
